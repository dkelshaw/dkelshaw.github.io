## **_Introduction_**
My name is Deirdre Kelshaw. I'm a senior at Lehigh University majoring in Journalism and Economics. At Lehigh, I have been a reporter for the school's newspaper in past years, but most recently I have become its Deputy Opinion Editor. In terms of my coursework, I'm using this page to host my data journalism projects.
