## **_Introduction_**
My name is Deirdre Kelshaw. I'm a senior at Lehigh University majoring in Journalism and Economics. 

In past years, I have been a reporter for the school's newspaper, _The Brown and White_, but most recently I have transitioned into a new role as Deputy Opinion Editor. 

In terms of my coursework, I am currently taking J025 and am using this page to host my data journalism projects.

This inforgraphic shows the various freshmen populations of Lehigh University's numerous schools. While many would think that Lehigh's school of engineering would yield the highest numbers, I was surprised to see that the College of Arts and Sciences actually has the largest first-year population. This finding shows that the engineering population at Lehigh is declining while more liberal arts focused areas are on the rise.

# Dropout Rates Across the Country
## Source: ["‘A dereliction of duty’: The college dropout scandal — and how to fix it"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/09/10/a-dereliction-duty-college-dropout-scandal-how-fix-it/) by Valerie Strauss

This infographic summarizes the most important data discussed in an interview with David Kirp, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of "The College Dropout Scandal." He discusses the demographic of students who dropout of college, based on the type of college they go to, their ethnicity, their financial situations, etc. The percentages included in the infographic were taken from his interview with The Washington Post, linked above. 


The bar chart data was collected from a separate interview Kirp did with [EdSource](https://edsource.org/2019/national-college-dropout-rates-are-a-scandal-uc-author-says/616248).
This chart shows the distinction between graduation rates at a private vs. public university. Kirp's most important findings include that over 40% of undergraduates drop out of college, more people of color drop out of college and more people drop out from public universities than from private universities. Based on these findings, individuals with these backgrounds are all more likely to drop out of college. These hold concerning problems for primarily public institutions and their state governments. Hopefully this data can serve as a tool to both of these institutions in order to bring about change for their students so that they can get the equal opportunity of graduation and receiving a full education.

This timeline follows the series of events that have occured throughout the history of the Le-Laf football rivalry-- a historic competition in which both schools strive to be the best in the Lehigh Valley.
