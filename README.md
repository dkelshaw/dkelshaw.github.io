## **_Introduction_**
My name is Deirdre Kelshaw. I'm a senior at Lehigh University majoring in Journalism and Economics. 

In past years, I have been a reporter for the school's newspaper, _The Brown and White_, but most recently I have transitioned into a new role as Deputy Opinion Editor. 

In terms of my coursework, I am currently taking J025 and am using this page to host my data journalism projects.

This inforgraphic shows the various freshmen populations of Lehigh University's numerous schools. While many would think that Lehigh's school of engineering would yield the highest numbers, I was surprised to see that the College of Arts and Sciences actually has the largest first-year population. This finding shows that the engineering population at Lehigh is declining while more liberal arts focused areas are on the rise.

# Dropout Rates Across the Country
## Source: ["‘A dereliction of duty’: The college dropout scandal — and how to fix it"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/09/10/a-dereliction-duty-college-dropout-scandal-how-fix-it/) by Valerie Strauss
<img src="https://github.com/dkelshaw/dkelshaw.github.io/blob/main/J25%20Infographic%20Assignment.png?raw=true" width="500" height="1200" />

This infographic summarizes the most important data discussed in an interview with David Kirp, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of "The College Dropout Scandal." He discusses the demographic of students who dropout of college, based on the type of college they go to, their ethnicity, their financial situations, etc. The percentages included in the infographic were taken from his interview with The Washington Post, linked above. 


The bar chart data was collected from a separate interview Kirp did with [EdSource](https://edsource.org/2019/national-college-dropout-rates-are-a-scandal-uc-author-says/616248).
This chart shows the distinction between graduation rates at a private vs. public university. Kirp's most important findings include that over 40% of undergraduates drop out of college, more people of color drop out of college and more people drop out from public universities than from private universities. Based on these findings, individuals with these backgrounds are all more likely to drop out of college. These hold concerning problems for primarily public institutions and their state governments. Hopefully this data can serve as a tool to both of these institutions in order to bring about change for their students so that they can get the equal opportunity of graduation and receiving a full education.

# Timeline Project

This timeline follows the series of events that have occured throughout the history of the Le-Laf football rivalry-- a historic competition in which both schools strive to be the best in the Lehigh Valley. 

# A Brief History of U.S. Environmental Policies

The information provided in the above timeline follows the changing patterns of climate change policies based on the country's prior and present presidents. Climate change impacts not only the U.S. but the entire world. It's important that every country do their part in trying to reduce their carbon emissions by enacting policies. Change won't come without a leader who cares. Primarily, viewers of this timeline can see that most recent presidents in office have attempted to lead the country in the right direction by enacting climate change policies. However, we see some who prioritize other areas, such as President George W. Bush. Overall, this timeline gives a peak into the types of political environments that existed prior to present day.

# Telling Stories by Building Charts

This is a bar chart created by using Chartbuilder. This chart shows the world's richest countries. Original data can be accesseed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ipWL_vKE0S6-gD9qyI_7OE4lF9K_z-VjiNqMoeMmB6c/edit?usp=sharing).

# 2019 Undergraduate College Enrollment
![What were the percentages of students in each of Lehigh's undergraduate colleges in 2019?](https://github.com/dkelshaw/dkelshaw.github.io/blob/main/Lehigh_College_Enrollment_2019_Percent_of_Undergraduate_Enrollment_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)

The information above shows the number of undergraduates who enrolled in each college at Lehigh in fall 2019. Overall, the College of Arts and Sciences had the greatest population size-- 36.6% of students enrolled in the school. I find this interesting as Lehigh is known for its large engineering population. However, it seems that recently, those numbers have decreased and enrollment is not as prominant as it once was. This data may portray the transition of undergraduate enrollments at Lehigh. Original data can be accessed [here](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2019.pdf).

# Class of 2024 SAT Profile
![What were the SAT Scores Among Lehigh 2024 Applicants and Admits?](https://github.com/dkelshaw/dkelshaw.github.io/blob/main/SAT_Scores_Among_Lehigh_2024_Applicants_and_Admits_Applicants_Admits_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)

This bar chart displays the SAT scores recorded from Lehigh University class of 2024 applicants and admits. Overall, we can see that most students who applied to Lehigh and took the SAT, and were accepted, received high scores between 1400-1490. Students who scored between an 1100-1190 had the smallest acceptance rate into the university. Based on this information, we can better understand the competitiveness of Lehigh admission, along with the average profile of Lehigh applicants and admits.

# Line Chart - Lehigh University College Enrollment Over the Past Five Years
![Fall 2017 - Fall 2021 Institutional Profile](https://github.com/dkelshaw/dkelshaw.github.io/blob/main/Fall_2017_-_Fall_2021_Institutional_Profile_Arts_&_Sciences_Business_Engineering_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)

This line chart shows the changes in undergraduate enrollment at Lehigh University over the past five years. Based on this data, we can see that enrollment in the College of Business has remained almost consistent throughout the past five years. Enrollment in the College of Engineering, on the other hand, has decreased over time. Lastly, enrollment in the College of Arts & Sciences has increased over time. Overall, this data shows the changing student identity at Lehigh. While Lehigh is known for its high population of engineering students, it seems that that may be changing. The original data can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-j4-QhE8xwccFXr7V54vsVVNE1ya93jGldg6Z34YATU/edit?usp=sharing).

# Scatter Plot - Looking at the Connection Between Happiness and GDP
![2017 Life Satisfication vs. GDP per capita](https://github.com/dkelshaw/dkelshaw.github.io/blob/main/Self-reported_Life_Satisfaction_vs._GDP_per_capita,_2017_Life_satisfaction_in_Cantril_Ladder_(World_Happiness_Report_2019)_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)

In an effort to look at the relationship between average measures of happiness and GDP within different countries, I created a scatter plot. Based on this data, it seems that there is a correlation between life satisfaction and GDP per capita. You can see that, in most cases, the lower the GDP per capita, the lower life satisfaction is. Higher GDP per capita seems to primarily lead to higher life satisfaction. There seems to be a positive correlation between the two variables. However, the country plotted with the highest GDP per capita has a lower measure of life satisfaction than some of the other countries with lower GDP per capita. This does not seem to be the primary trend, but it is worth mentioning. These findings matters because they show that overall wellbeing is, for the most part, much better in countries with higher wealth. Perhaps, this is not causation because there are other factors that can contribute to one's happiness. However, there is definitely a correlation between the two variables. The original data can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GqouSzpED6AiwiO778FcIerDmM27A0sXcteGO7Dvad8/edit).

# Time Series Chart Assignment - Frequency of Global Natural Disasters Over Time
![Looking at Natural Disasters Between 2010 and 2019](https://github.com/dkelshaw/dkelshaw.github.io/blob/main/Number_of_Natural_Disaster_Events_Globally_From_2010_to_2019_Natural_Disasters_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)

In order to better understand how the frequency of natural disasters has changed over time, I created a line chart documenting the number of times natural disasters occurred from 2010 t0 2019. As climate change is, and has been, a pressing issue for much time now, I wanted to see if natural disasters occurred more or less in the past 10 years with accessible data. Based on the results of this chart, it seems that natural disasters hit their peak in 2010 (at 427 events). The least amount of natural disasters occurred in next year however, in 2011 with 359 natural disaster events. It seems that after the initial drop in events from 2010 to 2011, natural disasters continued to rise, almost, back to its peak in 2010. Based on these results, it seems that the world may be moving backwards in its progress at alleviating climate change. The implications of this are that we, as a world, may be seeing more and more natural disasters in our lifetime if we don't work together to end climate change.

## The Top 15 Most Sustainable Cities in America
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1DAQt7PUkbB7A0m9yKNLpjUvg4SF2rAyh" width="640" height="480"></iframe> 

These are the 15 most eco-friendly cities in the United States, ranked by Rocket Homes. Based on this map, it seems that most environmentally-focused cities in America are located on the West Coast. In comparison, there are few in the middle of the country and some on the East Coast. In this way, sustainable cities are not equally distributed based on location and there is much more work to be done so that more American cities can help better our planet. Everyone has the responsibility. This ranking is important as it can allow leaders in other American cities/states to look at what the most environmentally-conscious cities are doing, and they can use it as a guide or inspiration for what their own cities can be doing.
