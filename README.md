## **_Introduction_**
My name is Deirdre Kelshaw. I'm a senior at Lehigh University majoring in Journalism and Economics. 

In past years, I have been a reporter for the school's newspaper, _The Brown and White_, but most recently I have transitioned into a new role as Deputy Opinion Editor. 

In terms of my coursework, I am currently taking J025 and am using this page to host my data journalism projects.
