## **_Introduction_**
My name is Deirdre Kelshaw. I'm a senior at Lehigh University majoring in Journalism and Economics. 

In past years, I have been a reporter for the school's newspaper, _The Brown and White_, but most recently I have transitioned into a new role as Deputy Opinion Editor. 

In terms of my coursework, I am currently taking J025 and am using this page to host my data journalism projects.

This inforgraphic shows the various freshmen populations of Lehigh University's numerous schools. While many would think that Lehigh's school of engineering would yield the highest numbers, I was surprised to see that the College of Arts and Sciences actually has the largest first-year population. This finding shows that the engineering population at Lehigh is declining while more liberal arts focused areas are on the rise.
