## **_Introduction_**
My name is Deirdre Kelshaw. I'm a senior at Lehigh University majoring in Journalism and Economics. 

In past years, I have been a reporter for the school's newspaper, _The Brown and White_, but most recently I have transitioned into a new role as Deputy Opinion Editor. 

In terms of my coursework, I am currently taking J025 and am using this page to host my data journalism projects.

This inforgraphic shows the various freshmen populations of Lehigh University's numerous schools. While many would think that Lehigh's school of engineering would yield the highest numbers, I was surprised to see that the College of Arts and Sciences actually has the largest first-year population. This finding shows that the engineering population at Lehigh is declining while more liberal arts focused areas are on the rise.

# Dropout Rates Across the Country
## Source: ["‘A dereliction of duty’: The college dropout scandal — and how to fix it"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/09/10/a-dereliction-duty-college-dropout-scandal-how-fix-it/) by Valerie Strauss

This infographic summarizes the most important data discussed in an interview with David Kirp, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of "The College Dropout Scandal." He discusses the demographic of students who dropout of college, based on the type of college they go to, their ethnicity, their financial situations, etc. The percentages included in the infographic were taken from his interview with The Washington Post, linked above. 


The bar chart data was collected from a separate interview Kirp did with [EdSource](https://edsource.org/2019/national-college-dropout-rates-are-a-scandal-uc-author-says/616248).
This chart shows the distinction between graduation rates at a private vs. public university. Kirp's most important findings include that over 40% of undergraduates drop out of college, more people of color drop out of college and more people drop out from public universities than from private universities. Based on these findings, individuals with these backgrounds are all more likely to drop out of college. These hold concerning problems for primarily public institutions and their state governments. Hopefully this data can serve as a tool to both of these institutions in order to bring about change for their students so that they can get the equal opportunity of graduation and receiving a full education.

# Timeline Project

This timeline follows the series of events that have occured throughout the history of the Le-Laf football rivalry-- a historic competition in which both schools strive to be the best in the Lehigh Valley. 

# A Brief History of U.S. Environmental Policies

The information provided in the above timeline follows the changing patterns of climate change policies based on the country's prior and present presidents. Climate change impacts not only the U.S. but the entire world. It's important that every country do their part in trying to reduce their carbon emissions by enacting policies. Change won't come without a leader who cares. Primarily, viewers of this timeline can see that most recent presidents in office have attempted to lead the country in the right direction by enacting climate change policies. However, we see some who prioritize other areas, such as President George W. Bush. Overall, this timeline gives a peak into the types of political environments that existed prior to present day.

# Telling Stories by Building Charts 
![What were the percentages of students in each of Lehigh's undergraduate colleges in 2019?](https://github.com/dkelshaw/dkelshaw.github.io/blob/main/The_World's_Richest_Countries_GPD_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)
This is a bar chart created by using Chartbuilder. This chart shows the world's richest countries. Original data can be accesseed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ipWL_vKE0S6-gD9qyI_7OE4lF9K_z-VjiNqMoeMmB6c/edit?usp=sharing).

# 2019 Undergraduate College Enrollment
![What were the percentages of students in each of Lehigh's undergraduate colleges in 2019?](https://github.com/dkelshaw/dkelshaw.github.io/blob/main/Lehigh_College_Enrollment_2019_Percent_of_Undergraduate_Enrollment_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)

The information above shows the number of undergraduates who enrolled in each college at Lehigh in fall 2019. Overall, the College of Arts and Sciences had the greatest population size-- 36.6% of students enrolled in the school. I find this interesting as Lehigh is known for its large engineering population. However, it seems that recently, those numbers have decreased and enrollment is not as prominant as it once was. This data may portray the transition of undergraduate enrollments at Lehigh. Original data can be accessed [here](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2019.pdf).

# Class of 2024 SAT Profile
![What were the SAT Scores Among Lehigh 2024 Applicants and Admits?](https://github.com/dkelshaw/dkelshaw.github.io/blob/main/SAT_Scores_Among_Lehigh_2024_Applicants_and_Admits_Applicants_Admits_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)

This bar chart displays the SAT scores recorded from Lehigh University class of 2024 applicants and admits. Overall, we can see that most students who applied to Lehigh and took the SAT, and were accepted, received high scores between 1400-1490. Students who scored between an 1100-1190 had the smallest acceptance rate into the university. Based on this information, we can better understand the competitiveness of Lehigh admission, along with the average profile of Lehigh applicants and admits.

# Line Chart - Lehigh University College Enrollment Over Time

This line chart shows the changes in undergraduate enrollment at Lehig University over the past five years. Based on this data, we can see that enrollment in the Business school has remained almost consistent throughout the past five years. Enrollment in the Engineering school, on the other hand, has decreased over time. Lastly, enrollment in the College of Arts & Sciences has increased over time. Overall, this data shows the changing student identity at Lehigh. While Lehigh is known for its high population of engineering students, it seems that that may be changing. The original data can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-j4-QhE8xwccFXr7V54vsVVNE1ya93jGldg6Z34YATU/edit?usp=sharing).
